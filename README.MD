# DAE Solution Storage

-----

To add a Collada file (```.dae``` extension file), firstly create a directory with the name of the file.

For example the ``Unit_Sphere.dae`` will be stored in the ``Unit_Sphere/`` directory.

All the textures and files concerning the collada file will be then stored in the same directory path, and will ease its use.
